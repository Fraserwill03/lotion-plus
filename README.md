# Lotion Plus
This respository houses the code for a lotion-like note taking web app

This was a group project, that I completed with Aarshshah9, for a web developement course.

- This project uses a react.js for the front-end, and an AWS based backend, using Lambda functions to create a CRUD API for Dynamodb.
- Lambda handlers were written with Python.
- AWS resources were created using Terraform.
- The app can be accessed with the link in NETLIFY-ADDRESS.
